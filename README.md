# Airport-managment-flight

This project encompassed the comprehensive modeling and implementation of an airline flight management system, termed "Manager_flight_informationSystem", and a customer interface, "Fly-Customer", using both Unified Modeling Language (UML) and Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs), backed by Java implementation.

**UML and Java Implementation:**
- Developed UML artifacts including class diagrams to outline interfaces, logic classes, and data classes, focusing on adding new flights and generating detailed reports.
- Crafted sequence diagrams to illustrate the process of flight additions, ensuring no scheduling conflicts with existing flights.
- Created statecharts to depict the dynamic states of flights in response to airport operations.
- The Java application was developed to align with the UML designs, featuring a user-friendly navigation system and populated with representative data to emulate real-world usage.

**DFD Modeling and Java Implementation:**
- Constructed DFDs for the "Fly-Customer" system, including context, level 0, and level 1 diagrams to detail the system's processes and data flow.
- Assembled a data dictionary to define all elements within the DFDs.
- Implemented the processes described in the level 1 DFD in Java, maintaining consistency with the DFD model and providing a mapping for any discrepancies in terminology.

The integration of UML and DFD methodologies facilitated a robust design framework, which was effectively translated into a functional Java application. This holistic approach ensured that the system was not only theoretically sound in its design but also practical and efficient in operation, with a strong emphasis on conflict-free scheduling and user experience.
